# Black Powder Datafiles 
BattleScribe Datafiles for Black Powder

# Known issues
These files do not track army wide restrictions such as "Only 1 Artillery battery per 6 infantry battalions in the army" this is restrictions that must be tracked by the player.

# Using time periods
All peninsular armies have a Time Period choice that must be taken, this restricts what kinds of upgrades may be taken and what battalions and brigades are available to the player. If you want to be able to pick a army, no matter the time period, then choose the "Any" period to disable the checks.
